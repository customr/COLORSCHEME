# COLORSCHEME

## Getting Started

This is my project for community group [COLORSCHEME](https://vk.com/nnovosch).
It was created to increase my level of Python knowledge and maybe for inspiration of designers.

## How it works

* Image fed to input
* Quantization happens (decrease quantity of colors)
* Quantizated colors fed to KMean alghoritm (read about it [HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering))
* KMean returns colors and its frequency
* ...**Many graphical interface procedures**
